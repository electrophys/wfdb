Package: libwfdb10
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: WaveForm Database library for physiologic signals
 The WFDB library supports creating, reading, and annotating digitized
 signals in a wide variety of formats. Input can be from local files or
 directly from web servers via libcurl. WFDB applications need not be
 aware of the source or format of their input, since input files are
 located by searching a configurable path and all data are transparently
 converted on-the-fly into a common format.

Package: libwfdb-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libwfdb10 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: WaveForm Database library - development files
 The WFDB library supports creating, reading, and annotating digitized
 physiologic signals. This package contains the header files, static
 library, and pkg-config file needed to develop WFDB applications.

Package: wfdb-tools
Architecture: any
Depends: libwfdb10 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: WaveForm Database applications
 Command-line tools for creating, reading, transforming, analyzing,
 annotating, and viewing digitized signals, especially physiologic
 signals. Includes digital filtering, QRS detection, signal averaging,
 power spectrum estimation, format conversion, and many others.

Package: wave
Architecture: any
Depends: wfdb-tools (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Waveform Analyzer, Viewer, and Editor
 WAVE provides a graphical environment for exploring digitized signals
 and time series. It supports fast, high-quality views of data stored
 locally or on remote servers, flexible control of analysis modules,
 efficient interactive annotation editing, and multiple simultaneous
 views.
